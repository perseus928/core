## Info for Developers

Your application does a bad comparison. Comparison is only defined on ints, floats, times, chars, strings, lists of comparable values, and tuples of comparable values. It looks like some other kinds of values got compared somehow. The root cause may be in your code or in a dependency.

You can get more detailed information on when this happens if you can reproduce the error in dev mode.

Hopefully that helps!
